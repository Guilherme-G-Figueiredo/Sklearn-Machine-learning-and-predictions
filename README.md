# Sklearn-Machine-learning-and-predictions
* Machine learning project in Python, using the libraries: sklearn and pandas

The project involves importing a CSV file and training an artificial intelligence model to recognize patterns between the columns and predict the credit score of new clients based on these recognized patterns. The pandas library was used for importing the CSV file, removing unnecessary columns and rows, and correcting errors. The sklearn library was used for label encoding, creating artificial intelligence models, training them, testing their accuracy, and making predictions for new clients.
