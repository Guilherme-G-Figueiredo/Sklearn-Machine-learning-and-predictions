# Sklearn-Machine-learning-and-predictions
* Machine learning project in Python, using the libraries: sklearn and pandas

The project involves importing a CSV file and training an artificial intelligence model to recognize patterns between the columns and predict the credit score of new clients based on these recognized patterns. The pandas library was used for importing the CSV file, removing unnecessary columns and rows, and correcting errors. The sklearn library was used to create the artificial intelligence models, train them, test their accuracy, and make predictions for new clients.
